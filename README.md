# THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS
# League of Gaming Website

## Reasons
This is a react and spring boot api based website
Me and my friends like to play the popular Game
League of Legends but we always missed some sort of
website to compare our ingame stats with each other.

## How it works (short)
To work this website needs my other Project (link here).
The website is needed for the Data of all my friend's accounts. 
Most data is then loaded directly from the api with some parts
of it coming from the riot datadragon-api directly
